## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello World!
<!--
**MichelleFizz/MichelleFizz** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

## Career:
 - I aspire to work in cybersecurity in the future because I think it's a good inbetween of computer science and directly helping people. Cybersecurity is also necessary for every company now a days and in the future. However, my preference would be to work for a federal government agency like the FBI and help them in things like counterterroism. I believe the term is white hat hacker and that's what I want to do in the future among other things.
